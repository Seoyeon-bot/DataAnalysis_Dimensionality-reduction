# DataAnalysis_Dimensionality-reduction
Perform dimensionality reduction. 

Use given dataset and finds first two components that will ensure 90% retained variance.
Plot the first two components in a figure, with horizontal axis (x) corresponding to the dimensions and vertical axis (y) corresponding to the mag- nitude of the component in this dimension. There will be 2 traces with d points in this figure.
Also save the top two components in a text file “Components.txt” in the code folder, with each com- ponent on a separate line and represented as dd comma-separated numbers (i.e. the file should have two lines with dd numbers separated by commas).
